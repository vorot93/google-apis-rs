## Issues

All issues, may it be feature requests, or bugs, are treated as **problems**.
In any case it is important to be able to reproduce or understand it. To help in doing so, please state the following information:

* a description of the problem
* steps to reproduce the problem (if applicable)
* library version showing the problem (if applicable)

The emphasis on the term **problem** originates from the observed tendency of issues being more like a solution to a problem,
which is not stated in detail, making good solutions more difficult to achieve.

## Pull Requests
